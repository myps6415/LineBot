# LineBot for my mom
## Introduction
My mom was worked in Central Weather Bureau (Taiwan, R.O.C).    
She resigned in my childhood to take care of me and my brother. But she still cares deeply about the weather.   
She download the [weather card](https://www.cwb.gov.tw/m/sv/ecardFB.php?ecls=5) and push on our family LINE group everyday.
